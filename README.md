# Business Ownership Should Look Like Us

## Does Business Ownership Look Like America?

Not yet. We are missing over 2 millions businesses owned by women and people of color.

For company ownership to reflect the gender, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, that is what would be necessary. If ability, tenacity, and inventiveness are assumed to be widely dispersed, then there are probably 2.4 million women and people of color who wish to launch enterprises that employ people but are now stuck on the sidelines.

## Why Does It Matter?

Over 20 million new jobs for all Americans regardless of gender or color.

The fundamental underpinning of American economic innovation and leadership, the creation of new firms, is at a 40-year low. We require these entrepreneurs' innovative thinking and tenacity on the business scene. More than 20 million additional employment and a 20% (over $4 trillion) boost in our GDP would result in company ownership in the United States.

## Aren't We Getting There Anyways?

If current trends continue, it would take more than a century to get there.

Finding a technique to reduce the gap to 10 years is the aim of this research. We admit that it is an ambitious, if not little insane, ambition. However, so was the notion of founding America. In order to get there, we will need to break down the obstacles including social, emotional, and financial capital. We must examine what has stopped it from happening. Join us with your ideas, initiative, and contacts since this is a team sport.

Notes on Data: 

Due to insufficient businesses in that state, the Annual Business Survey did not always give company numbers for certain racial, ethnic, and gender combinations, which has implications for the quality and privacy of the data. Although the real number may be somewhat over zero, we replaced these occurrences with an estimate of zero businesses in order to keep track of the number of firms for these groupings. Additionally, we decided to only include businesses with a majority of female owners in our calculations, rather than those with female owners who make up a smaller percentage of the ownership.
