## Business Ownership Should Look Like Us

Does Business Ownership Look Like America?

Not yet. We are missing over 2 millions businesses owned by women and people of color.

That is what it would take for business ownership to match the gender, race, and ethnic diversity of the United States. If we assume that talent, grit, and ingenuity is widely distributed, that means that there are likely 2.4 million women and people of color who want to start businesses that hire employees, but are currently stalled on the sidelines.

Why Does It Matter?

Over 20 million new jobs for all Americans regardless of gender or color.

Starting new businesses, the fundamental base of U.S. economic innovation and leadership, is at a 40 year low. We need the richness of ideas and hard work that these entrepeneurs bring to the business playing field. If business ownership did look like America there would be over 20 million new jobs in the U.S. and our GDP would increase by 20% (over $4 trillion). 

Aren't We Getting There Anyways?

If current trends continue, it would take more than a century to get there.

So we started The Decade Project. The goal is to shrink the gap to 10 years instead. An audacious goal - maybe even a little crazy - we admit. But so was the idea of creating America. We have to look at what has prevented it from happening, and to get there we will have to knock down the financial, social, and emotional capital barriers. This is a team sport; join us with your ideas, initiative, and connections.

This Data

On the next tabs, take a look at the state and see how close are we. 

Data Source: 
            Employer firms data is from the Annual Business Survey in the year of 2020. Data Link: https://data.census.gov/table?q=AB2000CSA01
            Population data is from the U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates, 2020. Data Link: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/

Notes on Data: Due to insufficient businesses in that state, the Annual Business Survey did not always give company numbers for certain racial, ethnic, and gender combinations, which has implications for the quality and privacy of the data. Although the real number may be somewhat over zero, we replaced these occurrences with an estimate of zero businesses in order to keep track of the number of firms for these groupings. Additionally, we decided to only include businesses with a majority of female owners in our calculations, rather than those with female owners who make up a smaller percentage of the ownership.
